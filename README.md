# Coin_tossing_simulation

Simple GIF file creation in R to simulate the average number of heads from random samples of 10,000 coin tosses, R is so much fun, based on a basic script from Probability, Decisions, and Games, a Gentle Introduction Using R, by Abel Rodriguez and Brune Mendes. I added the animation using the example from Alboukadel Kassambara (https://lnkd.in/graDGGJ) using Trellis (a solid but not so popular graphics package in R).
